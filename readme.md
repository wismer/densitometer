### densitometer


##### Notes so far...

1. amt of light that passes through space
2. tells what gel to put into it
3. primary colors & light density is read
4. similar to... rgba values (red, green, blue, opacity)
5. name structure of gels are like `<COMPANY><PRODUCT_ID>`, i.e. lee121
6. find closest match - not all gels will be in pristine condition
